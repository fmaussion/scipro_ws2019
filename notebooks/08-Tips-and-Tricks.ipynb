You know (almost) everything you need to know about the syntax, but you might be a little lost in all the possibilities the language is now offering to you. *Which tool should I use to do this and that? How was this function signature again?* This chapter will briefly give you some tips to help you out during your assignments."

The advantages of IDEs is that they ship with tools that make your life easier when programming. \n",

    "Here is a non-exhaustive (and subjective) list of the tools a good IDE should have:\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)\">linter</a>: automatic detection of syntax errors and style violations\n",
    "- [debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger): helping you find where the errors in your program come from\n",
    "- [intelligent code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion): automatic `TAB` completion, module recognition, etc.\n",
    "- project explorer and code exploration tools\n",
    "- for interactive languages: a command line and variable explorer\n",
    "- appealing colors and graphics\n",
    "- ...\n",

    "- [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/): the IDE made by and for scientists. It resembles the Matlab IDE and has many nice features such as variable exploration and an integrated ipython console. It is very easy to install with conda, and is therefore available on linux at the university (``$ spyder &``). **It is my recommended IDE for this semester's course**.\n",
    "- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): this is my current personal favorite. It is however quite heavyweight and can be confusing for beginners. The community version is free.\n",
    "- [Atom](https://atom.io/): a modern, very nice looking editor. Useful if you program in more than one language, but you must install additional packages to transform it in a real IDE\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (from Microsoft) is one of the newest \"cool kid\" around. I have not tested it myself, but people seem very happy with it. Like Atom, you'll have to install plugins for it to become a true python IDE.\n",
    "- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): for people allergic to the mouse. Not recommended for most of us, but the people who learned to use them are (allegedly) the fastest programmers ever."
